Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. This is an ongoing project where the objective is to build a Machine Learning model which can effectively predict clients whom are capable of repaying loans on time. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.

The dataset is taken from the Kaggle website and the link can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk
